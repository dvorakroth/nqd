# Niqqudizator

*For some of your Niqqud needs!*

This is a small single-page web application for manually adding Niqqud to Hebrew text, with a focus on mobile devices, where currently-existing solutions (back in the day) were fiddly and inconvenient.

Developed in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for stylesheets.
