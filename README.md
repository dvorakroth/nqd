# Niqqudizator

*For some of your Niqqud needs!*

This is a small single-page web application for manually adding Niqqud to Hebrew text, with a focus on mobile devices, where currently-existing solutions are fiddly and inconvenient.

Developed in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for stylesheets.

(This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.24.)
